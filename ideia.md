Below are a few structured directions — from subtle performance-engineering proof points to lightweight WebGL/Three.js showcases — that fit your profile (React/TypeScript engineer focused on speed, reliability, composability).

⚙️ 1. Interactive “Tech Showcase” Section

Goal: Demonstrate your frontend depth (WebGL, performance, micro-interactions) without turning your site into a gimmick.

Ideas:

3D “Experience Map” – a minimal 3D scene (using three.js + React Three Fiber) showing your career timeline as floating cards (Valtech, BairesDev, Plasma). Hovering a card animates a small particle burst or reveals metrics (“32% faster load times”).
→ Shows: WebGL integration, animation control, composable architecture.

Component-Performance Visualizer – simulate component re-renders (a graph or real-time counter) to illustrate your obsession with optimization.
→ Shows: React profiler mindset, animation & data visualization.

“System View” Canvas – a subtle background canvas of connected nodes (like network packets or data flow) that subtly react to mouse movement.
→ Shows: React + canvas + event handling; looks like “fast, invisible systems”.

💡 Use react-three-fiber + drei for simplicity. Keep frame rate high, memory low — this will itself prove performance expertise.

🧠 2. Engineering Case-Study Demos

Goal: Let visitors use something you’ve built — short, scoped demos hosted on your portfolio domain.

Ideas:

Design System Sandbox:
Embed a live Storybook or a small component playground where people can interact with a few components (buttons, modals, animations).
→ Shows: UI library architecture, accessibility, documentation discipline.

Performance Playground:
A side-by-side demo: “Before optimization / After optimization”. Use something like bundle analyzer results, frame render times, or lazy loading metrics.
→ Shows: tangible engineering impact, measurable outcomes.

Convex/TanStack Demo:
A small demo using your Plasma stack (React + Convex + TanStack Router) — e.g., a mini todo list with real-time updates.
→ Shows: full-stack fluency, reactive data flows, serverless understanding.

🧩 3. “Behind the Scenes” Engineering Notes

Goal: Add technical depth without code dumps — similar to blog posts, but visually engaging.

Ideas:

A “Build Log” section: short cards like “How I achieved 98 Lighthouse score on this site” / “Migrating design systems to React 18 concurrent features” / “Offline sync in Plasma”.
→ Each card links to a medium-length post (with diagrams, metrics).

A “Stack Overview” visualization: small diagram showing layers — Frontend (React/Next.js/Vite) → APIs (tRPC/GraphQL) → Infra (AWS/Lambda/Vercel). Use animated SVG lines or canvas.

This keeps your site useful for recruiters and engineers reading deeper.

🎨 4. Subtle Interaction Enhancements

Goal: Communicate polish through micro-interactions that feel effortless.

Ideas:

Smooth page transitions using the View Transitions API (the animation you mentioned earlier, like nmn.sh/blog).
→ Shows: adoption of emerging browser tech.

Hover-reveals on project cards: reveal stack icons or metrics when hovered.

Parallax scroll in hero section (slight motion tied to scroll position).

Cursor-based magnetic effects (light reflection, 3D tilt).
→ All subtle, not flashy. Emphasise frame rate and performance.

🚀 5. AI / Data-Driven Demo

Since you’re also comfortable with AI/GenAI and have Convex experience:

AI-powered UI generator: A small demo where users can type “generate a login screen” and it produces a styled component using your design system tokens (just conceptually).

Real-time data dashboard: Use mock API to show charts updating smoothly.
→ Shows: backend integration + UI reactivity + “product feel”.

🧭 6. Interactive Timeline / Map

Goal: Replace the boring text résumé section with a dynamic one.

Ideas:

Vertical or horizontal timeline where each milestone expands into a small modal with achievements, metrics, screenshots.

Or, if you want to hint 3D: make a “journey path” (camera scrolls through Valtech → BairesDev → Plasma nodes).
→ This ties together your career story and your mastery of 3D or animation frameworks.

🧱 7. Tech-Driven Footer / Easter Egg

Keep it light but memorable:

“Inspect this site”: a console log Easter egg that prints your stack + build time.

Or a “Performance mode toggle” in the footer that benchmarks current FPS / load time when clicked.
→ Shows confidence and craft.

🧭 Priority Recommendations for you

Given your profile (senior, React/TypeScript, focus on performance, composable systems, European market):

Tier	Feature	Why
Must-Add	View Transition animation between pages (Title/Project)	Light, modern, subtle tech mastery
Should-Add	3D / WebGL micro-scene (career timeline or system map)	Visually memorable proof of technical depth
Should-Add	“Performance Playground” case study	Reinforces your engineering maturity
Nice-to-Have	“Stack Visualization” or “Build Log” posts	Shows transparency & leadership
Optional Flair	Console Easter egg or performance toggle	Personality + confidence
